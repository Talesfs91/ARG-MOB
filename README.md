# ARG-MOB
This repository provides documentation for the analysis in the preprint manuscript "Mobilization of antibiotic resistance genes differ by resistance mechanism" by Tue Kj√¶rgaard Nielsen, Patrick Denis Browne, and Lars Hestbjerg Hansen. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.10.426126v1

The scripts are not meant to be downloaded and run as programs, but only serve to document the analyses. 
"ARG_MOB_v0_4.sh" is the main script and contains the most information.
For the R parts of the analysis, a markdown document is provided, along with the resulting, interactive, html output that contains code documentation along with plots and results.
