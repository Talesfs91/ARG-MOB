# ARG-MOB
This repository provides documentation for the analysis in the preprint manuscript "Mobilization of antibiotic resistance genes differ by resistance mechanism" by Tue Kj√¶rgaard Nielsen, Patrick Denis Browne, and Lars Hestbjerg Hansen. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.10.426126v1

"ARG_MOB_v0_5.sh" is the main script and contains the most information. Please edit paths and variables in the top of the script to match your paths before running the script. 

It is required that you also download the file "ARGMOB_dbs.tar.gz", before running the script. This file contains all necessary data files to run the analyses.

The "ARG_MOB_v0_5.sh" script will take a long time to finish. When it is done, the file "argmob_data.tar.gz" will be generated. This file is required input for the Rmarkdown script "ARGMOB_clean.rmd" which will perform statistics and generate plots. Before running the Rmarkdown script, please make sure you have the required packages installed (listed in the Rmarkdown document) and change the working directory to a suitable location. It is recommended to Knit the Rmarkdown document to a html output file, as this will allow for interactive tables and figures.
